## CSEC Assignment Submission

Hello there, I had a lot of fun solving these tasks since I am relatively new to CTFs and CSEC (I started with the CTF that you guys conducted). Please find the following details about me:

1. Email Id: pradiptabora@cse.iitb.ac.in
2. Name: Pradipta Parag Bora
3. Department: CSE
4. Year: First (about to go to second)
5. Enthu: I am very enthusiastic about the field of cybersecurity since I always loved solving puzzles and when you have cybersecurity it becomes a game of wits that involves not only programming but also knowing a lot about infrastructure and strategising about the right approach. I had a lot of fun solving challenges in the IITB CTF (although I participated for only one day since I had to participate in another competition held by Microsoft from the second day and this we ended up quite behind in the leaderboard). I want to learn more about this field and participate in more CTFs. That is why I am applying for this post since I believe the club will allow me to develop and at the same time impart whatever I've learnt to others. I believe that I will get the right platform through this club to learn more about cybersecurity.


The writeups for the tasks are in the respective folders along with the code. I've tried to provide an insight into my line of attack while solving the problems instead of directly blurting out the solution and so initially the writeup may digress from the intended way of solving but I guess that makes for a more enlightening write up. I've used python for scripting mostly (my favourite language).

Thanks for an interesting set of assignment problems and I learnt different ways of solving such challenges through these.
